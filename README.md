# Outlier Flagger in Thermal Images
#### During an UT Inventor Sprint, an UT employee voiced his issues regarding repairs of the rooftops of UT buildings. He flies a drone with a thermal camera over every rooftop and has to manually look at every single photo to determine whether repair was needed or not. He is looking for a way to lessen his workload. I noticed that every single rooftop that needed repair had a region where the temperature was much higher or lower than surrounding areas, so I created this application. This app regionalizes the rooftop, checks for any area where it is surrounded by a much larger area with a noticeable temperature difference, and flags any that tests positive. The program does not narrow the number of photos that need to be manually looked at by a significant amount but is a good start for further development.
